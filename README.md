# rock-paper-scissors
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Javascript, played in
the console. Users play five rounds against the computer, and the 
number of wins for each player are counted. At the end of five rounds,
a final victor is declared based on the larger number of wins (or 
otherwise, a tie is declared).
