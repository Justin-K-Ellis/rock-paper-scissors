# rock-paper-scissors
This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Javascript, with an 
HTML and CSS GUI. Users play five rounds against the computer, and the 
number of wins for each player are counted. At the end of five rounds,
a final victor is declared based on the larger number of wins (or 
otherwise, a tie is declared).
